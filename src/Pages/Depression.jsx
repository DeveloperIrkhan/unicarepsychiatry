          <p className="f-18-n">
            Depression, also known as major depressive disorder, is a common and
            serious medical illness that adversely affects how you feel, think,
            and behave. Fortunately, it is treatable. Depression causes feelings
            of sadness and a loss of interest in activities you once enjoyed. It
            can lead to a variety of emotional and physical problems and can
            decrease your ability to function at work and at home.
