            Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) is a chronic relapsing brain disorder
            characterized by an impaired ability to control alcohol intake,
            leading to significant distress or functional impairment. It
            encompasses a spectrum of behaviors, from hazardous drinking to
            alcohol dependence, and is often accompanied by physiological and
            psychological dependence on alcohol.

                About Alcohol use disorder (AUD)?
              </p>
              Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) is a complex medical condition
              characterized by the compulsive consumption of alcohol despite
              adverse consequences. It involves a dysregulated relationship with
              alcohol, resulting in a range of behaviors from excessive drinking
              to physical and psychological dependency. AUD is often associated
              with significant impairment in various aspects of life, including
              social, occupational, and health-related domains.
